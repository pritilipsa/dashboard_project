 E-commerce Store Sales Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive data analysis of an e-commerce store's sales and order data. The goal is to extract meaningful insights into sales performance, identify key customer segments, and understand operational trends. The findings are visualized to support data-driven decision-making for business growth and optimization.
